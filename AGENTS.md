# AGENTS.md - Coding Agent Guidelines for LNVPS Web

This file is an index. Load only the specific doc(s) relevant to your task to minimize context usage.

## Before Starting Any Task

**1. Estimate the size** of the change using t-shirt sizing:

| Size | Lines of change | Action                                 |
| ---- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| XS   | < 50            | Proceed directly                       |
| S    | 50–250          | Proceed directly                       |
| M    | 250–750         | Proceed directly                       |
| L    | 750–2,500       | Proceed directly                       |
| XL   | > 2,500         | **Stop — split into increments first** |

If the estimate is XL, create a work file in `work/` that decomposes the task into L-or-smaller increments, then work through them one PR at a time. See [docs/agents-common/incremental-work.md](docs/agents-common/incremental-work.md) for the work file format.

**2. Check `work/`** for an active task file on the same topic before starting new work. If one exists, resume from the first unchecked task.
