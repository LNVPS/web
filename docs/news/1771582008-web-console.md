We're excited to announce the new Web Console feature!

You can now access your VM's terminal directly from your browser - no SSH client required. This is perfect for quick maintenance tasks, debugging, or when you're away from your usual workstation.

Simply navigate to your VM and click the Console button to get instant terminal access.

Features:

- Real-time terminal access via WebSocket
- Connection status indicator
- One-click reconnect if disconnected
- WebGL-accelerated rendering for smooth performance

This feature is especially useful when you need to troubleshoot network issues that might prevent SSH access.

**Note:** To use the web console, you'll need to set a password for your user via SSH first by running `passwd`.
